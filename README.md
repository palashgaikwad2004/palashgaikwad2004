### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m **Palash Gaikwad**, an engineering student and developer from India.  
I enjoy building things with **Python, Java, C, and C++**, and I love working on **AI, IoT, and software projects**.

I’ve done internships in **Web Development**, **AI-ML**, and **Python**, where I worked on real-world applications and learned how to solve problems efficiently.

Some of the projects I’ve built include:
- **AtmosGuard** — IoT system for air quality and environment monitoring  
- **Phishing Detector** — ML model to detect phishing SMS/emails  
- **Highway Wind Turbine** — designed a cross-flow turbine for power generation

I enjoy learning new technologies, experimenting with ideas, and turning concepts into real working prototypes.
